**Task 2 -- Rest Assured Test Automation**

**Test cases proposed for Automation:**

**1) Endpoint: Pet**

a\) Creation of a new pet

b\) Getting a list of pets available

c\) Finding a pet with the id

d\) Updating a pet detail

**2) Endpoint: User**

a\) Getting user details with username

b\) Creating a new user

c\) Activating and deactivating a session (Log in and Log out)

d\) Updating user detail

e\) Deleting a user

**3) Endpoint: Store**

a\) Creating a new order

b\) Finding an order using id

c\) Finding list of orders

**Possibilities of automating above scenarios are quite high if the
server level API works as expectation which is the focus of automation,
thus reduction of overall time of actual manual inputs. But there could
be some pros and cons such as:**


**Pros:**

a\) Reduction in execution time using automation which could otherwise
be taken by manually testing API's.

b\) The proposed APIs are the ones which hold the core functionality of
the swagger provided, thus implementing them would ensure the maximum
testing coverage for the APIs.

**Cons:**

a\) The Open-API becomes unstable at times, and it could alter the
results of automation test suite providing altered results.

b\) The automation results could be impacted when the server is not
available or the changes in the API's are made by the development team.
